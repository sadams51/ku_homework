			<p>An analytical, data-focused linguist turned developer. 
			I have found coding to be a great fit for my aptitudes and I am diving into the adventure of the KU Coding Bootcamp with an open mind and desire for knowledge and improvement.</p>

			<p>My education background lies in Anthropology and Linguistics. I completed my undergraduate studies at Kansas State University with a BA in Anthropology and minor in Spanish. I completed a year of study towards an MA in Linguistics at Trinity Western University in British Columbia, Canada. The concepts captured my imagination and the data collection and analysis capturd my mental focus. After assessing career goals I decided to alter my course toward coding in order to gain a skillset I believe will benefit any and every aspect of my future career.</p>

			<p>I am a Native of Kansas, but at home in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. I fill my spare time with running, hiking, climbing, yoga, campfires, coffee, books, and friends. I'm on a quest to fill in some critical gaps in my film knowledge and I am always up for an ernest discussion about language, health, psychology, politics, religion, or other such enigmatic topics. </p>
